# Library Management Application

This application serves as a platform for managing library resources with distinct views for administrators and users.

## Admin View

In the Admin view, authenticated administrators have access to the following functionalities:

- Add books: Admins can add new books to the library database, including details such as title, author, genre, and quantity.
- Delete books: Admins can remove existing books from the library database.

### Authentication

Admins must authenticate themselves to access the admin view. Authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can perform administrative tasks.

## User View

In the User view, library members can perform the following actions:

- View books: Users can browse the available books in the library along with their details.
- Search books: Users can search for specific books by title, author, or genre to find relevant resources.
- Sort books: Users can sort the displayed books based on criteria such as title, author, or availability.
- Request a book: Users can request to borrow a book from the library. This action may involve placing a hold on a book if it's currently unavailable.

### Book Availability

The system dynamically updates book availability based on user requests and returns. If a book is checked out by a user, its availability status is updated accordingly.
